To be able to expose port 3306 of the Docker image to Windows I started Docker from the command line using the following command

	docker run -p 3306:3306 mysql/mysql-server:latest

This created a new Container in my Docker Desktop (which I can now stop and start from the GUI, it maintains the correct config)
	lucid_goldwasser
	336cea850716fedb68c8dfbfd4d85007a3c7d086346b4882de516c258ad631a1

The default root password, listed in the startup command was ;41=OkvM_A2=r9TS7LtRm.:F6o,c#T27

While using netstat I could now see port 3306 I still could not connect. Two reasons:

1) root password needs to be changed
2) root user must be allowed from other addresses: by default it's only from localhost, but localhost refers to the docker image itself

To change the root password
	Opened a new admin cmd window
	Ran: docker exec -it 336cea850716fedb68c8dfbfd4d85007a3c7d086346b4882de516c258ad631a1 bash
	Issued (in mysql>): ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
		# note: root is the new password
	Issued (in mysql>): flush privileges;

To allow connections from outside docket localhost 

	Verified only localhost allowed:
	SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
	+-----------+------------------+
	| host      | user             |
	+-----------+------------------+
	| localhost | healthchecker    |
	| localhost | mysql.infoschema |
	| localhost | mysql.session    |
	| localhost | mysql.sys        |
	| localhost | root             |
	+-----------+------------------+
	5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

then:

	UPDATE mysql.user SET host='%' WHERE user='root';

now:

	mysql> SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
	+-----------+------------------+
	| host      | user             |
	+-----------+------------------+
	| %         | root             |
	| localhost | healthchecker    |
	| localhost | mysql.infoschema |
	| localhost | mysql.session    |
	| localhost | mysql.sys        |
	+-----------+------------------+
	5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

and now I can connect using MySQL Workbench which I previously downloaded and installed.

I created a new schema called db to mantain alignment with Thiago's configuration

To run the FRONT END

1) Installed nodejs
2) opened the terminal in the frontend folder (C:\Users\Administrator\IdeaProjects\COMP47910-project\frontend)
3) run "npm install"
4) ran "npm install -g @vue/cli"
5) ran "vue serve"
